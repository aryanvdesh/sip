## Online Courses:
- CS50's Introduction to Computer Science
    - An introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.
    - Platform: [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)

- CS50's Understanding Technology
    - This is CS50’s introduction to technology for students who don’t (yet!) consider themselves computer persons.
    - Platform: [edX](edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology)

- CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
    - This course picks up where Harvard University’s CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By semester’s end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.

- Linear Algebra
    - This course parallels the combination of theory and applications in Professor Strang’s textbook Introduction to Linear Algebra. The course picks out four key applications in the book: Graphs and Networks; Systems of Differential Equations; Least Squares and Projections; and Fourier Series and the Fast Fourier Transform.

- Highlights of Calculus
    - Highlights of Calculus is a series of short videos that introduces the basics of calculus—how it works and why it is important. The intended audience is high school students, college students, or anyone who might need help understanding the subject.

- Project Tuva: Richard Feynman's Messenger Lecture Series
    - Project Tuva was a collaborative research project with Bill Gates in 2009 demonstrating the potential of interactive video learning by highlighting the “core scientific concepts” of Richard Feynman’s Messenger Lectures Series. Upon release, the first of the seven lectures: The Law of Gravitation – An Example of Physical Law, was brought to life with interactive visualizations, links to searchable transcripts, integrated note taking capabilities and other features. The Silverlight application was retired in 2016, but the Richard Feynman videos are still available below.
